    abstract="What is nowadays the central part of any introduction to logic, and indeed to some the logical theory par excellence, used to be a modest fragment of the more ambitious language employed in the logicist program of Frege and Russell. `Elementary' or `first-order', or `predicate logic' only became a recognized stable base for logical theory by 1930, when its interesting and fruitful meta-properties had become clear, such as completeness, compactness and L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem. Richer higher-order and type theories receded into the background, to such an extent that the (re-) discovery of useful and interesting extensions and variations upon first-order logic came as a surprise to many logicians in the sixties.",
